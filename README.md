I always forget to update these, but here goes
### 13/8/2014
- Soldiers now move 2 spaces at once. This cuts down on
infected surviving in corners and behind walls/bodies.
- Introduction of a new unit, the Angel. The Angel comes
every 200 turns and lands in a random, free space. They
have a radius of 3x5 and heal all infected in that radius
with a 75% chance success rate. They don't stay on the
board after they cast their conversion spell, but this
may change in the future (probably will).
- Added a terminal-friendly default size grid if no arguments
are supplied (20x79) Original idea by ![Ilovecock](https://github.com/ilovecock "Ilovecock")
- Added a display bar at the bottom which shows you the
amount of citizens, infected, and days passed.
