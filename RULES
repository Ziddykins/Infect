The town starts with one soldier, ten doctors and three infected.
Everything except blank spaces and bodies get to take an action, and
that action is in a random direction (N, W, S, E).

After all units have taken an action, the move function is called
where the unit again picks a random direction. If the direction which
they picked is open, they move to it.

Infected action (75% chance to do nothing):
If action is towards a citizen:
-->Citizen is infected
If action is towards a doctor/nurse:
-->25% chance doctor/nurse dies
-->25% chance infected dies
-->5% chance infected converted to nurse
-->25% chance doctor/nurse converted to infected
-->5% chance infected is healed to citizen
-->5% chance infected healed to soldier
-->10% chance they both die.

Doctor actions:
-->7% chance to convert citizen or infected to nurse
-->1% chance to revive a dead person back to a citizen

Nurse actions:
-->3% chance to convert citizen or infected to nurse
(I saw your post after whoever saved the thread, and I
agree that infected should be trained into citizens
before being trained into doctors. This will be fixed.)


Citizen action (98% chance to do nothing):
-->1% chance to become doctor (get his shit together)
-->1% chance to become infected (airborne apparently)
-->15% chance to build a wall. Walls discussed more at the end.

Soldier action:
Picks a random spot in a 2x3 radius from itself.
If a citizen is in the 2x3 radius, do not shoot
If there is no infected in their radius, do not shoot (!!NOT ADDED YET!!)

It has a 25% to perform its action, its action depending on what is picked.
If it picks a doctor or a nuse:
-->1% chance the doctor/nurse is killed :(
If it picks an infected:
-->infected dies
If it picks a body:
-->body is cleaned up (empty space)
If it picks a citizen:
-->20% chance to convert citizen into oldier

Walls:
After 100 days, citizens can build walls. The town has a limited supply
of wood (5000 currently). Each wall takes between 1 and 25 wood to build
once out of wood, there is no getting more (yet?). Currently the building
AI is absolutely terrible especially since they move each turn.
